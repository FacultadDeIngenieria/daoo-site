# Aprender de los errores de los demás

- Design Principles
- Architectural Pattern
- Design Patterns

???
- *Design principles* are widely applicable laws, guidelines, biases and design considerations which designers (professionals from many disciplines) apply with discretion
- An *architectural pattern* is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software architecture
- A *design pattern* is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design

Design patterns are usually associated with code level commonalities, while architectural patterns are seen as commonality at higher level than design patterns.

# Software Rot

- Increased difficulty to adapt and maintain (software becoming less responsive or buggier through time)

--

- Causes
 - Communication / documentation breakdown

--

 - Design is not resilient in the face of change

--

- Code written carelessly with little thought for readability, maintenance and extension will rot faster than code written with a long term view

???
Software rot is either a slow deterioration of software quality over time or its diminishing responsiveness that will eventually lead to software becoming faulty, unusable, or in need of upgrade. This is not a physical phenomenon: the software does not actually decay, but rather suffers from a lack of being responsive and updated with respect to the changing environment in which it resides.

# Design Principles

- Decomposition
- Abstraction and Information Hiding
- Modularity
- Depencency Management
- SOLID principles
- Don’t repeat yourself
- Occam’s Razor
- KISS

???
- Abstraction, information hiding, and encapsulation are very different, but highly-related, concepts. One could argue that abstraction is a technique that helps us identify which specific information should be visible, and which information should be hidden.

- SOLID
 - S	SRP	(Single responsibility principle)
La noción de que un objeto solo debería tener una única responsabilidad.
 - O	OCP	(Open/closed principle)
La noción de que las “entidades de software" deben estar abiertas para su extensión, pero cerradas para su modificación.
 - L	LSP	(Liskov substitution principle)
La noción de que los “objetos de un programa deberían ser reemplazables por instancias de sus subtipos sin alterar el correcto funcionamiento del programa”.
 - I	ISP	(Interface segregation principle)
La noción de que “muchas interfaces cliente específicas son mejores que una interfaz de propósito general”.
 - D	DIP	(Dependency inversion principle)
La noción de que se debe “depender de abstracciones, no depender de implementaciones”.

- DRY: besides using methods and subroutines in code, rely on code generators, automatic build systems, and so on. Apply it quite broadly to include database schemas, test plans, build system, even documentation.

- Occam's Razor: 14th-century logician and theologian William of Ockham states that the **simplest explanation is usually true**.

- KISS: simplicity should be a key goal in design and unnecessary complexity should be avoided

# Architectural Patterns

- Layers
- MVC
- Pipe and Filter
- SOA
- Event-Driven Architecture
- Microservices
- Session

???

- Layers: grouping of related functionality within an application into distinct layers that are stacked vertically on top of each other.
- SOA: is a style of software design where services are provided to the other components by application components, through a communication protocol over a network.
- EDA: message-driven architecture, software architecture pattern promoting the production, detection, consumption of, and reaction to events.
- Session: Client Session State, Server Session State, Database Session State

# Design Patterns

## Creational Patterns
*Deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.*

- Abstract Factory:
- Builder
- Factory
- Prototype
- Singleton

---

# Design Patterns

## Structural Patterns
*Ease the design by identifying a simple way to realize relationships between entities.*

- Adapter
- Bridge
- Composite
- Decorator
- Façade
- Flyweight
- Proxy

---

# Design Patterns

## Behavioral Patterns
*Identify common communication patterns between objects. Increase flexibility in carrying out this communication.*

- Chain of Resp.
- Command
- Interpreter
- Iterator
- Mediator
- Memento
- Observer
- State
- Strategy
- Template
- Visitor
