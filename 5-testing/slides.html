# Testing types

There are many different types of testing that you can use to make sure that changes to your code are working as expected.
Not all testing is equal, though, and we will see here how the main testing practices differ from each other.

# Automation based on the phase of testing

- Unit Tests:
Low level, close to the source of your application.
In general quite cheap to automate and can be run very quickly in CI.

- API Tests:
These tests target the testing based on request and response on which the application is built.

- UI based tests:
These test the functionality and business logic of the application from the front end of the application.

Not everything under the sun can be automated.

---

# Integration tests

- Verify that different modules or services used by your application work well together.
- These types of tests are more expensive to run as they require multiple parts of the application to be up and running.

---

# Functional tests

- Can be seen as a type of Integration test.
- Focus on the business requirements of an application.
- Non-functional tests define requirements related to performance, security, databases etc.

---

# End-to-end tests

- Replicates a user behavior with the software in a complete application environment.
- They're expensive to perform and can be hard to maintain.

---

# Performance testing

- Check the behaviors of the system when it is under significant load.
- These tests are non-functional, and can have the various form to understand the reliability, stability, and availability of the platform.
- Performance tests are by their nature quite costly to implement and run, but they can help you understand if new changes are going to degrade your system.

---

# Smoke testing

- Basic tests that check basic functionality of the application.
- They are meant to be quick to execute, and their goal is to give you the assurance that the major features of your system are working as expected.
- Smoke tests can be useful right after a new build is made to decide whether or not you can run more expensive tests, or right after a deployment to make sure that they application is running properly in the newly deployed environment

---

# Exploratory testing

- The question is whether it is still worth doing manual testing?
- It should be focused on what is called exploratory testing where the goal is to uncover non-obvious errors.
- Testing session should not exceed two hours and need to have a clear scope to help testers focus on a specific area of the software
- Ex: complex user workflows, releasing a significant new capability

# Parametrized testings

When running a parameterized test class, instances are created for the cross-product of the test methods and the test data elements.

```
@RunWith(Parameterized.class)
public class FibonacciTest {

    @Parameters public static Collection<Object[]> data() {
        return Arrays.asList(new Object[][] {
            { 0, 0 }, { 1, 1 }, { 2, 1 }, { 3, 2 }, { 4, 3 }, { 5, 5 }, { 6, 8 }
        });
    }

    @Parameter public int fInput;

    @Parameter(1) public int fExpected;

    @Test public void test() {
        assertEquals(fExpected, Fibonacci.compute(fInput));
    }
}

public class Fibonacci {
    ...
}
```

---

# Property based testing


```
BOOST_AUTO_TEST_CASE(correctlyParsesNumbers) {
    BOOST_CHECK(parseSignedInteger("0") == 0);
    BOOST_CHECK(parseSignedInteger("3") == 3);
    BOOST_CHECK(parseSignedInteger("15") == 15);
    BOOST_CHECK(parseSignedInteger("1337") == 1337);
}
```

Why only four test cases? Is that enough? How much is enough?

# Property based testing

Generating test cases so you don’t have to

- QuickCheck, a framework to solve this exact problem for the Haskell programming language.
- Specify properties of your code that should hold regardless of input.
- Randomly generates the input data to try to find a case for which the property fails.
- When such a case is found, it tries to find a minimal test case by shrinking the input data.
- This minimal test case is then reported for easy reproduction.
- This form of testing became known as property based testing and is actually the dominant form of testing in the Haskell ecosystem

---

# Property based testing

- Generating test cases so you don’t have to
- Property based testing relies on properties.
- It checks that a function, program or whatever system under test abides by a property
- Property: something that is alwasy true in your context.
- Property Testing: try random things, to test something you are sure of.

---

# Property based testing Benefits

- Cover the scope of all possible inputs: it can theorically generate all possible inputs
- Shrink the input in case of failure: whenever it fails, the framework tries to reduce the input to a smaller input
- Reproducible and replayable: a seed is produced in order to be able to re-run the test again on the same datasets

# Example

```
@Property
public void literalOperand(String operand)
{
    final String result = repl(operand);
    assertThat(result, equalTo(operand));
}
```

---

# Generators

When we use entities as our input for our unit tests

```
@RunWith(JUnitQuickcheck.class)
public class PostalParcelPBTTest {

    @Property
    public void deliveryCostsShouldBeMaxWhenWeightIsGreaterThan20(@InRange(minInt = 21) PostalParcel postalParcel){
        assumeThat(postalParcel.weight(), greaterThan(20));

        assertThat(postalParcel.deliveryCosts(), equalTo(com.baasie.pbt.part1.PostalParcel.MAX_DELIVERY_COSTS));
    }
}
```
