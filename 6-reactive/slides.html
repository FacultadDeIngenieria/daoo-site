# Dependency

Dependency or dependent means relying on something for support

# Dependency Injection

---

# Dependency injection

Types:
- Constructor injection: the dependencies are provided through a class constructor.
- Setter injection: the client exposes a setter method that the injector uses to inject the dependency.


It's the dependency injection’s responsibility to:
- Create the objects
- Know which classes require those objects
- And provide them all those objects

---

# Inversion of control

It is the fifth principle of S.O.L.I.D which states that *a class should depend on abstraction and not upon concretions* (in simple terms, hard-coded).

According to the principles, a class should concentrate on fulfilling its responsibilities and not on creating objects that it requires to fulfill those responsibilities.

And that’s where dependency injection comes into play: it provides the class with the required objects.

# Benefits of using Dependency Injection

- Helps in Unit testing.
- Boiler plate code is reduced, as initializing of dependencies is done by the injector component.
- Extending the application becomes easier.
- Helps to enable loose coupling.

---

# Disadvantages of Dependency Injection

- Many compile time errors are pushed to run-time.
- If overused, can lead to management issues.
- Can hinder use of IDE automation, such as “find references”, “call hierarchy” and refactoring.

# The Reactive Manifesto

- Systems built as Reactive Systems are more flexible, loosely-coupled and scalable.
- They are significantly more tolerant of failure and when failure does occur they meet it with elegance rather than disaster.
- Reactive Systems are highly responsive, giving users effective interactive feedback.

# Reactive Systems

- Responsive:
The system responds in a timely manner if at all possible.
Problems may be detected quickly and dealt with effectively.

--

- Resilient:
The system stays responsive in the face of failure.
Failures are contained within each component, and thereby ensuring that parts of the system can fail and recover without compromising the system as a whole.
High-availability is ensured by replication where necessary.

--

- Elastic:
The system stays responsive under varying workload.
React to changes in the input rate by increasing or decreasing the resources allocated to service these inputs.
The ability to shard or replicate components and distribute inputs among them.

--

- Message Driven:
Rely on asynchronous message-passing to establish a boundary between components that ensures loose coupling and isolation.
Employing explicit message-passing enables load management, elasticity, and flow control by shaping and monitoring the message queues in the system and applying **back-pressure** when necessary.
**Non-blocking** communication allows recipients to only consume resources while active, leading to less system overhead.

# Reactive Programming

An asynchronous programming paradigm concerned with **data streams and the propagation of change**.

Observable emits streams of data which the Observer listens and reacts to, setting in motion a chain of operations on the data stream.

Operators allow you to transform, combine, manipulate, and work with the sequences of items emitted by Observables.
